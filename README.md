# Master-final-project
Web design for a hotel with HTML, CSS and Javascript. In this project I assumed the entire process of web design, from the creation of the prototype on Figma (UX/UI) until the website layout with the most famous languages. 
I began with HTML and CSS for the basic structure and I continued with Javascript to achieve the web can interact with the user. 
At finally, I had to transform the documents in Php to publish them on Cdmon.

The web is completely responsive, so has two differents menus. The famous "Burger Menu" for mobile and the classic "Navbar" for desktop.
